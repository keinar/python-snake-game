# Python Snake Game

Welcome to the Python Snake Game! This is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the game boundaries or itself.

## Installation

To run this game, you will need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/keinar/python-snake-game.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required dependencies:

```
cd python-snake-game/myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

To start the game, run the following command in the terminal:

```
python main.py
```

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake.
- The game speeds up slightly each time the snake eats food.

## Object-Oriented Design

The game is designed with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, with separate classes for the `Game`, `Snake`, and `Food` components.

## AI Trainer

An AI trainer is currently under development to teach the game how to play and level up automatically using machine learning techniques.
